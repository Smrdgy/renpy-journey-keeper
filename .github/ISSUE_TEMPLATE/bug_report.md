# ‚ùóBefore you start, make sure the bug isn't a known problem and that it wasn't reported already.‚ùó
Additionally make sure, you have tried these steps:
**1.** Check the #troubleshooting  and #known-issues sections.
**2.** Make sure you are running the latest version of the mod.
**3.** Make sure this is the only mod you are running at the time of the issue.
**4.** Make sure it's not the game's fault (e.g. game crashes at specific point even though the mod is not loaded).
**5.** Check whether this specific issue wasn't posted before.

## Report guidelines

The names of the game and the creator are to guide me towards their Patreon/SS/itch/F95/etc., so that I can download the game and debug the issue. I won't be downloading anything from random URLs!

If you are including `traceback.txt`, please make sure it corresponds with your issue and is not some old one from some other previous crash.

‚ö†Ô∏è Be careful not to post any adult content üîû in here. I don't really mind it, but since GitHub is for all ages, they most likely will.

Once you are done reading this, delete this whole section. It's only for your information.
