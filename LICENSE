Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to use
the Software for personal or internal purposes, subject to the following
conditions:

1. Redistribution of the Software in its unmodified form, in source, compiled or archived
   form, is prohibited without prior written permission from the copyright
   holder, except in the following case:

   - The Software may be bundled with a commercialized video game, provided
     that the Software is not sold or distributed independently from the
     game and the game’s primary value is not derived from the Software.

2. Redistribution of modified versions of the Software is permitted, provided
   that:
   - The modifications are non-trivial and add meaningful differences to the
     original Software. Superficial changes — such as renaming, recoloring,
     or rebranding without functional or creative contribution — are not
     sufficient on their own.
   - The modified version is clearly marked as such and does not misrepresent
     itself as the original Software.
   - The modified version includes prominent notice of the changes made.
   - The redistribution is for non-commercial purposes only, unless it falls
     under the bundling exception described in Clause 1 or is otherwise
     granted by express written permission from the copyright holder.
   - The redistribution complies with all other terms of this license.

3. This license does not grant permission to use the Software for other
   commercial purposes, including but not limited to selling copies of the
   Software or using it as part of a commercial service, except for the
   bundling exception described in Clause 1.

4. The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included
   in all copies or substantial portions of the Software, modified or
   unmodified.
